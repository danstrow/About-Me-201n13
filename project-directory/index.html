            <h1>Daniel Olson About Me</h1>
            <p>
                As a student, I want to create an impactful About me page <br>
                to demonstrate my new found HTML skills</p>
            <p>As a marketer, I want to <em>enhance</em>my design skills to showcase <br>
               my skills to potential future employers</p>
               <p>As a loose cannon, I want to make visitors of my page scratch <br>
               their heads and maybe chuckle a little</p>
               <p>As a new developer, I want to use markup to properly structure <br>
                  my page so the layout and design looks great and makes sense</p>
               <p>As a developer, I want to carefully design my scripts so I can <br>
                  understand how to organize and write my code</p>   
               <p>As a developer who is also a marketer, I want to personalize my code <br>
                  by creating prompts to receive the users name</p>   
               <p> As a great guy with a bad girl attitude, I want to learn to code!</p>
